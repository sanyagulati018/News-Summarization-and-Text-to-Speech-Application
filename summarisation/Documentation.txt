1. Project Setup
Steps to install and run the application:

Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher installed.

A valid API key for GNews API.

Installation
Clone the repository or download the project files.

Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
cd <project-directory>
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Application
Open the main.py file and replace the api_key variable with your GNews API key:

python
Copy
api_key = "your_gnews_api_key_here"
Run the application:

bash
Copy
python main.py
The application will:

Fetch news articles for the specified company (e.g., "Google").

Analyze the sentiment of each article.

Summarize the article content.

Convert the summary to Hindi speech and save it as an MP3 file.

Play the generated audio.

2. Model Details
The project uses pre-trained models from the transformers library by Hugging Face for summarization and sentiment analysis.

Sentiment Analysis
Model: distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english

Purpose: Analyze the sentiment of the news article content.

Output: Returns POSITIVE or NEGATIVE.

Text Summarization
Model: facebook/bart-large-cnn

Purpose: Summarize the news article content into a shorter version.

Output: Returns a summarized text with a maximum length of 130 characters.

Text-to-Speech (TTS)
Library: gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)

Purpose: Convert the summarized text into Hindi speech.

Output: Saves the speech as an MP3 file and plays it.

3. API Development
The project uses the GNews API to fetch news articles.

API Endpoint
URL: https://gnews.io/api/v4/search

Parameters:

q: Query string (e.g., company name).

lang: Language of the articles (e.g., en for English).

country: Country code (e.g., us for the United States).

max: Maximum number of articles to fetch (e.g., 10).

token: Your GNews API key.

Accessing the API
You can test the API using tools like Postman or directly via the browser.

Example API request:

Copy
https://gnews.io/api/v4/search?q=google&lang=en&country=us&max=10&token=your_api_key
API Response
The API returns a JSON response with the following structure:

json
Copy
{
  "articles": [
    {
      "title": "Article Title",
      "url": "Article URL",
      "description": "Article Summary",
      "content": "Article Content"
    }
  ]
}
4. API Usage
Third-Party APIs Used
GNews API:

Purpose: Fetch news articles related to a specific company.

Integration: The fetch_news function in api.py makes a GET request to the GNews API and processes the response.

Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS):

Purpose: Convert summarized text into Hindi speech.

Integration: The text_to_speech_hindi function in utils.py uses the gTTS library to generate and save the audio file.

5. Assumptions & Limitations
Assumptions
API Key: The user has a valid GNews API key.

Input: The company name provided is valid and returns relevant news articles.

Language: The sentiment analysis and summarization models are optimized for English text.

Text-to-Speech: The TTS functionality is limited to Hindi and may not support other languages without modification.

Limitations
API Rate Limits: The GNews API has rate limits (e.g., 100 requests per day for the free tier).

Model Accuracy:

Sentiment analysis may not always be accurate for ambiguous or neutral text.

Summarization may lose some context for very long or complex articles.

TTS Quality: The quality of Hindi TTS depends on the gTTS library and may not be perfect for all text.

Dependencies: The project relies on third-party libraries and APIs, which may change or become unavailable in the future.

6. Future Improvements
Support for Multiple Languages: Extend TTS functionality to support more languages.

Error Handling: Improve error handling for API requests and model predictions.

Caching: Implement caching to reduce API calls and improve performance.

User Interface: Develop a web or mobile interface for easier interaction.

Advanced Models: Use more advanced models for sentiment analysis and summarization.
